  <p>While many of the projects I’ve worked on are confidential or proprietary to the company,
    I can share a few that I’m particularly proud of and that reflect my skills and contributions.</p>

  <h2 class="project-title">Programming Pi</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
     During a period when I was deeply exploring microcontrollers, I created this video to demonstrate how to properly flash and upload retro console game emulators onto a Raspberry Pi 3. 
     It was an exciting project that introduced me to SSH, remote file transfer, and the process of loading an operating system onto a microcontroller—laying the groundwork for my interest in embedded systems.

    <h2 class="project-title">Repairing Board</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    My curiosity was sparked when the master window switch in my dad’s car—responsible for controlling all the windows—stopped working. 
    I took the opportunity to investigate the failure, and in the process, I learned how to use a digital multimeter (DMM) and perform detailed visual inspections to diagnose and repair faulty electrical components.

  <h2 class="project-title">Educational Videos</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    While in college, I often found that certain engineering concepts weren’t given enough time or depth during lectures. 
    I used these moments as an opportunity to apply what I had learned over the years to create more efficient ways of approaching and solving engineering problems. 
    To this day, I continue to upload videos that I believe can help other aspiring engineers better understand complex topics and improve their problem-solving skills.

  <h2 class="project-title">Arduino & RGB</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    I really enjoyed learning how to program Arduinos to create dynamic effects with programmable RGB LEDs. 
    This was one of my first hands-on projects using both Arduino and RGB lighting, and it sparked my interest in embedded systems and creative electronics.

  <h2 class="project-title">Battery Replacement</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    This video covers basic fundamentals of electrical engineering, where I explain the differences between series and parallel battery configurations, 
    and demonstrate how to diagnose and replace faulty batteries on an electric moped.

  <h2 class="project-title">Webpage Development</h2>
 <p class="project-description">
    This very webpage has been a valuable learning experience, helping me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to shape the layout and functionality of a site. 
    It’s been a fun and rewarding project, and I plan to actively maintain and improve it as I continue advancing my skills in web development and layout design.
