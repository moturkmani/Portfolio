        <h2>Exploring New Tech & AI</h2>
        <p>As an electrical engineer with a lifelong passion for tinkering, I’ve always been fascinated by how electronics
            work and how they shape the world around us. Growing up, I loved taking things apart just to see how they ticked.
        </p>
        <p>Lately, that same curiosity has led me into the world of AI, where I’ve been exploring tools and technologies that boost
            efficiency and productivity. It’s been exciting to see how merging traditional engineering with modern AI can unlock entirely new ways of solving problems.

        <h2>Building & Fixing</h2>
        <p>My passion for technology has driven me to explore and master a wide range of hands-on skills. It began with building custom desktop PCs—something I continue
           to do with a strong focus on performance, value, and efficiency. I use my knowledge of how components interact to create optimized, high-performing systems
           tailored to any budget, whether it's for gaming, productivity, or creative work.</p>
        <p>That same curiosity extends into electronics repair. I actively troubleshoot and fix failed devices around the house by investigating root cause failures
            and finding cost-effective ways to restore functionality. From replacing phone screens and batteries to full housing swaps and board-level soldering,
            I’ve developed a strong skill set supported by my personal soldering station, which allows me to diagnose and repair even complex circuit issues.</p>
        <p>Growing up with a father who was a master mechanic, I also picked up a deep appreciation for working with my hands. Over the years, I’ve learned to
            do my own oil changes, brake replacements, shock and tire swaps, and even custom car audio installations—including stereo head units, subwoofers, and amplifiers. 
            These experiences have shaped my resourceful, detail-oriented mindset—one that thrives on learning, building, and solving real-world technical challenges.</p>

        <h2>Content Creation (YouTube)</h2>
        <p>My journey into YouTube started with a passion for sharing educational, simplified solutions to common technical problems—primarily
           focused on electronics, computer-related issues, and general DIY repair projects. I take pride in being a hands-on problem solver, and my channel
           reflects that mindset by offering how-to guides, PC hardware/software fixes, and even academic support content for engineering students.</p>
        <p> Over time, the channel has gained enough traction to become part of the YouTube Partner Program, allowing me to earn a substantial amount in ad revenue. 
            It's been incredibly rewarding to turn my curiosity and technical skills into something that not only helps others but also supports itself financially.

        <h2>Camping Out</h2>
        <p>I’ve always loved the outdoors, but my first camping trip in Utah took that passion to a whole new level.
            Being surrounded by nature, disconnected from daily routines, is something I find incredibly refreshing.
            Camping has become a deeply rewarding hobby that keeps me grounded and rejuvenated—and
            it’s something I plan to continue for the rest of my life.

        <h2>Creating Custom Vinyls</h2>
        <p>I enjoy designing custom vinyls and bumper stickers for friends and family, often inspired by anime themes and
            humorous text. It's a fun and creative outlet that lets me express my artistic side and bring smiles to others.
            Crafting vinyls has become a rewarding hobby, and I plan to keep growing my skills and ideas during my free
            time—especially as I build out my Etsy platform and aim for continued growth.

        <h2 class="glow-title">Old School RuneScape</h2>
        <p>
          I am not much of a gamer, but the hours I put into this game would still consider it a hobby. I grew up playing Old School RuneScape (OSRS), and it quickly became
          more than just a game—it was the foundation of my competitive mindset. Whether it was grinding for rare items or mastering new skills, OSRS taught me the value of persistence,
          goal-setting, and continuous improvement. That same drive to grow, push boundaries, and embrace new challenges is what fuels me today as an engineer. 
          Even now, I’ll occasionally log in—not just for nostalgia, but to reconnect with the mindset that shaped my passion for learning and excelling.
