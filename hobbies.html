    <h2>Hobby 1: Playing Old School RuneScape</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite hobbies! Old School RuneScape (OSRS) is a classic MMORPG that I find both relaxing and engaging.
        I enjoyed exploring the world, completing quests, and leveling up skills. I’ll occasionally log on to cut down trees or fish lobbies (IYKYK). </p>
    <p>It's a game that has a lot of nostalgia and keeps me coming back for new content and challenges.</p>

    <h2>Hobby 3: Creating Custom Vinyls</h2>
    <p>I love creating vinyls and bumper stickers, especially around the themes of cartoons and funny texts. Making vinyls allows me to share insights on what I can do as an individual.</p>
    <p>It’s a rewarding hobby that I plan to expand as I continue to grow my platform on Etsy.</p>
