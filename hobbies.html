        <h2>Exploring New Tech & AI</h2>
        <p>As an electrical engineer with a lifelong passion for tinkering, I’ve always been fascinated by how electronics
            work and how they shape the world around us. Growing up, I loved taking things apart just to see how they ticked.
        </p>
        <p>Lately, that same curiosity has led me into the world of AI, where I’ve been exploring tools and technologies that boost
            efficiency and productivity. It’s been exciting to see how merging traditional engineering with modern AI can unlock entirely new ways of solving problems.

        <h2>Camping Out</h2>
        <p>I’ve always loved the outdoors, but my first camping trip in Utah took that passion to a whole new level.
            Being surrounded by nature, disconnected from daily routines, is something I find incredibly refreshing.
            Camping has become a deeply rewarding hobby that keeps me grounded and rejuvenated—and
            it’s something I plan to continue for the rest of my life.

        <h2>Creating Custom Vinyls</h2>
        <p>I enjoy designing custom vinyls and bumper stickers for friends and family, often inspired by anime themes and
            humorous text. It's a fun and creative outlet that lets me express my artistic side and bring smiles to others.
            Crafting vinyls has become a rewarding hobby, and I plan to keep growing my skills and ideas during my free
            time—especially as I build out my Etsy platform and aim for continued growth.

        <h2 class="glow-title">Playing Old School RuneScape</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite hobbies! Old School RuneScape (OSRS) is a classic MMORPG that I find both relaxing and engaging.
            I enjoyed exploring the world, completing quests, and leveling up skills. I’ll occasionally log on to cut down trees or fish lobbies (IYKYK).
            It's a game that has a lot of nostalgia and keeps me coming back for new content and challenges.
