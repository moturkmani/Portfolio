    <h2 class="glow-title">Playing Old School RuneScape</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite hobbies! Old School RuneScape (OSRS) is a classic MMORPG that I find both relaxing and engaging.
       I enjoyed exploring the world, completing quests, and leveling up skills. I’ll occasionally log on to cut down trees or fish lobbies (IYKYK).
       It's a game that has a lot of nostalgia and keeps me coming back for new content and challenges.</p>

    <h2>Exploring New Tech</h2>
    <p>As a tech enthusiast, I love exploring the latest gadgets and innovations. From building computers to testing new software, I’m always on the lookout for something new to learn or experiment with.</p>
    <p>I created this image with ChatGPT prompting it to convert an image I had to anime-style using Studio Ghibli. Tech is constantly evolving, and it's thrilling to be a part of that progress.</p>

    <h2>Creating Custom Vinyls</h2>
    <p>I love creating vinyls and bumper stickers, especially around the themes of anime and funny texts. Making vinyls allows me to share insights on what I can do as an individual.
        It’s a rewarding hobby that I plan to expand as I continue to grow my platform on Etsy.</p>

    <h2>Hobby 4: Camping Out</h2>
    <p>I love the outdoors. From the first time I went camping in Utah, I fell in love with the outdoors even more!
       It’s a rewarding hobby that keeps me rejuvenated. I will continue this as long as I am alive!</p>
