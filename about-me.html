  Hi, I’m <strong>Mojtaba Turkmani</strong>, but you can call me Mo, Moj, or even Mojo—whatever works for you. From a young age, I developed a strong work ethic and <strong>a passion
  for learning</strong>. My journey hasn’t always been easy—I faced challenges early on, but those experiences only strengthened my resilience and drive to succeed.  
  <p>I pushed myself academically, particularly in STEM subjects, and developed <strong>a love for problem-solving</strong>. By high school, I had found my confidence—wrestling helped, and I surrounded myself with a diverse group of friends. 
  But what truly set me on my path was tinkering with electronics, a passion I developed as a freshman. I spent countless hours fixing and experimenting with electronics, a skill that would later shape my career. 
  When I started college, I initially pursued Computer Engineering but later switched to Accounting, thinking it would be an easier route. However, I quickly realized I was cheating myself out of a career I was truly passionate about. 
  Determined to challenge myself, I made the leap into Electrical Engineering, a decision that set me on the right course. After earning my degree from San Diego State University, I embarked on a professional journey that has shaped me into the engineer I am today.</p> 
  
  <p>Currently, I work as an <strong>Electrical Engineer</strong> at L3 Harris Technologies in Utah, where I focus on developing and optimizing technical solutions. My career has allowed me to <strong>apply my skills in problem-solving,
  automation, and system reliability</strong> while working alongside talented professionals. Beyond engineering, I’m <strong>passionate about personal growth, mentorship, and giving back</strong>. I believe in spreading positivity and
  sharing knowledge with future generations. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, camping, and spending time with my wife & kiddo.
  Through every challenge, I’ve remained <strong>focused on continuous improvement—both professionally and personally</strong>.</p> 
  
  <p>My journey has been one of resilience, ambition, and gratitude, and I strive to make a meaningful impact
  wherever I go. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!</p>
