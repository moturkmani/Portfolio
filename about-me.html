Hi, I’m <strong>Mojtaba Turkmani</strong>, but you can call me Mo, Moj, or even Mojo—whatever works for you. I was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and from a young age, I developed a strong work ethic and <strong>a passion
for learning</strong>. My family faced significant challenges, but my father’s determination to build a better future led us to the United States. Adjusting to life in America wasn’t easy. When we arrived,
I was 9 years old and didn’t speak a word of English. I was often bullied for my clothes, my cheap Payless shoes, and simply for being different. But I refused to let that define me.
I pushed myself academically, particularly in STEM subjects, and developed <strong>a love for problem-solving</strong>. <p><br>Middle school wasn’t much easier, but I was fortunate to have good friends who had my back during those tough years.
By high school, I had found my confidence—wrestling helped, and I surrounded myself with a diverse group of friends. But what truly set me on my path was tinkering with electronics, a passion I developed
as a freshman in high school. I spent countless hours fixing and experimenting with circuits, a skill that would later shape my career. When I started college, I initially pursued Computer Engineering but
later switched to Accounting, thinking it would be an easier route. However, I quickly realized I was cheating myself out of a career I was truly passionate about. Determined to challenge myself, I made the
leap into Electrical Engineering, a decision that set me on the right course. After earning my degree from San Diego State University, I embarked on a professional journey that has shaped me into the engineer
I am today.</p> <p><br>Currently, I work as an <strong>Electrical Engineer</strong> at L3 Harris Technologies in Utah, where I focus on developing and optimizing technical solutions. My career has allowed me to <strong>apply my skills in problem-solving,
automation, and system reliability</strong> while working alongside talented professionals. Beyond engineering, I’m <strong>passionate about personal growth, mentorship, and giving back</strong>. I believe in spreading positivity and
sharing knowledge with future generations. In my free time, I enjoy exploring Utah’s beautiful outdoors, camping, and spending time with my wife, Tahira, and our daughter, who was born just before Pi Day.
Through every challenge, I’ve remained <strong>focused on continuous improvement—both professionally and personally</strong>.</p> <p><br>My journey has been one of resilience, ambition, and gratitude, and I strive to make a meaningful impact
wherever I go. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!</p>
