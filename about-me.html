Hi, I’m <strong>Mojtaba Turkmani</strong>, but you can call me Mo, Moj, Mojo, or even Mojito—whatever works for you.
I was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and by the time I was almost 8, I had already made a name for myself as a top student,
even though life was tough. <strong>Growing up</strong> in a poor family meant I often faced bullying at school,
but I had a dream: work hard, get good grades, and eventually escape poverty.
What I didn’t know was that my dad had the same vision for us—and he was already planning our escape.
Let me take a moment to talk about my father. A self-made man, he started working as an assistant mechanic
at 12 and was a master mechanic by 18. He had seen firsthand the struggles in Afghanistan,
especially under the Taliban, and decided to make a move. Saving money, he eventually got us out of Afghanistan
and we sought refuge with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, where we stayed
for about 8 months while our case was processed. My dad’s goal was clear—America offered opportunities, and as a father,
he wanted the best future for his sons. After being resettled in Tucson, Arizona, we lived there for a while before moving
to San Diego, California. I was 9 years old at the time, and my world was flipped upside down. I didn’t speak a word of English,
and once again, <strong>I was bullied</strong> for my clothes, the cheap Payless shoes, and not fitting in. But I wasn’t going to let that hold me back.
I excelled academically, particularly in STEM subjects. I’ll always be grateful to my friends Tony Tai and Jamar Lyons for having my back
during those tough middle school years. <strong>Despite all the challenges, I pushed through</strong>. High school was a turning point. My friend group was
as diverse as it gets—Indian, Arab, Black, Mexican, Honduran, Cambodian, Japanese, you name it. We were probably the most eclectic crew
at school. Shoutout to my late friend Joven Payumo (RIP) for introducing me to Josue Moreno, one of my best friends to this day. Wrestling helped
me build confidence, and by the time I graduated, I was taking AP courses and pushing myself to the limit academically. I was also fixing
electronics on the side—tinkering was my thing. I decided to take the community college route, and after a couple of years at Grossmont College,
I shifted from a computer engineering major to accounting (an easy out, right?). But something clicked during that time. I felt like I was
shortchanging myself, so I made another leap into Electrical Engineering. Thank you to Mr. Robinson for encouraging me. After transferring to SDSU,
I struggled—not because I couldn’t handle the work, but because I was distracted by entrepreneurial dreams. I wanted to build a business, not just get
a degree. But my dad’s sacrifices kept me grounded, and with that motivation, <strong>I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering</strong> and fulfilled a dream of his.
Today, I’m living in Utah, where I moved in 2020 during the pandemic. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’m now working as an Electrical Engineer
at L3 Harris Technologies. I’m married to my amazing wife, Tahira, and we have a daughter who turned 2 in March 2025—she was born right before Pi Day,
so now I’ll always remember her birthday! I’ve grown to love the outdoors, camping, and Utah’s stunning winters.
Through everything, <strong>my goal in life</strong> is simple: to <strong>spread positivity</strong> and always <strong>strive to be a better human</strong>. I’ve had my fair share of setbacks,
but I’ve never lost sight of my purpose. My hope is to <strong>help others</strong> where I can, share knowledge with future generations, and always be at peace with who I am.
Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope you’ve gotten a better understanding of who I am and what I stand for.
