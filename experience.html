    <p><strong>Senior Associate Electrical Engineer<br>Aug. 2023 - Present<br>L3 Harris Technologies | Salt Lake City, UT</strong></p>
    <p>Anticipating potential layoffs at WAVE Charging, I proactively transitioned into my current role as a Senior Associate Electrical Engineer. In this capacity,
        I diagnose and resolve technical issues in production test systems, support technicians with product setup and automated test executions, and collaborate with
        cross-functional teams to ensure project deadlines are met. A key aspect of my role includes developing and implementing automation test systems, as well as validating
        TestStand code through both automated and manual testing to ensure system reliability. Additionally, I have authored procedural documents and test plans that serve as essential
        guides for production teams. As a Special Test Electrical Engineer, I effectively leverage available resources and work closely with my team to address and resolve complex technical challenges.</p>

    <p><strong>Testing & Validation Engineer<br>Oct. 2022 – Aug. 2023<br>WAVE Charging | Salt Lake City, UT (Hybrid)</strong></p>
    <p>As a Testing & Validation Engineer, I performed high and low-voltage testing of 125kW and 250kW wireless charging systems for commercial vehicles.
      My work involved troubleshooting and repairing high-powered rectifiers, electrical cabinets, and charging pads. I validated firmware through software and hardware interactions,
      and performed extensive reliability testing to ensure compliance with QA standards. Additionally, I analyzed test data to create comprehensive manuals and instructions for clients, 
      ensuring they could maintain system performance and reliability.I dedicated time to conducting tests alongside technicians on the production floor, following the test procedures I had developed.
      I actively sought feedback to ensure the procedures were clear, efficient, and easy to follow. Whenever I identified opportunities to improve the process, I made sure to implement those changes
      to enhance efficiency. Additionally, I contributed as a member of the R&D team, playing a key role in the successful testing and validation of the 500kW wireless charging system. By ensuring the
      testing environment adhered to safety protocols and met industry standards, we were able to conduct a thorough and secure test, delivering reliable results for our client. Due to the company's
      financial difficulties, unforeseen layoffs became inevitable. Anticipating the organization's inability to recover, I made the proactive decision to voluntarily depart before my position was affected.
      This proved to be a strategic choice, as the company has yet to overcome its financial challenges to this day.

    <p><strong>Manufacturing Associate Test Engineer<br>Oct. 2021 - Oct. 2022<br>Snap One | Draper, UT (Hybrid)</strong></p>
    <p>During my time at Snap One, I was promoted to a Manufacturing Associate Test Engineer after doing so well on the technician side of things. In this role, I assembled test systems and fixtures while conducting both manual and automated testing.
      I performed soldering on circuit board components, ensuring functionality and troubleshooting issues based on test results. I also managed materials
      procurement according to the bill of materials (BOM) and ensured that all components met the required quality standards. 
      I also had an active role in the R&D team, where I traveled to various warehouse sites to sample new products before their launch. I conducted extensive
      tests to ensure both quality and performance. Whenever a product required additional troubleshooting, I was always willing to travel and collaborate with other teams to resolve the issue efficiently.</p>

    <p><strong>RMA/Electronics Technician<br>Mar. 2021 - Oct. 2021<br>Snap One | Draper, UT</strong></p>
    <p>As an RMA/Electronics Technician, I was responsible for repairing electronic products using bench and stress testing,
      as well as reliability and QA testing. Most of the units under test were returned from the field due to failures, and my responsibility was to identify the issues, troubleshoot potential fixes,
      and create datasheets if I observed recurring failure trends. I worked closely with a team to pinpoint and categorize these recurring issues for further resolution. Additionally, I documented
      repair data using SAP and Salesforce, and created JIRA tickets for critical technical problems, which helped streamline and accelerate the repair process.</p>

    <p><strong>Technical Support Engineer<br>July 2020 - Mar. 2021<br>Instructure | Salt Lake City, UT (Remote)</strong></p>
    <p>I initially took on this role as a way to relocate from California during the pandemic. However, as a Technical Support Engineer, I quickly found myself managing over 50 support tickets a day,
      resolving technical issues for Canvas platform users. I kept detailed records of bugs and collaborated closely with the development team to assist with debugging. Additionally, I provided customer
      support, helping users with account setup, course navigation, and general inquiries. My efficient and approachable problem-solving style led to consistently high customer satisfaction rates. From the
      outset, I realized this role wasn't challenging enough, so after just three months, I proactively reached out to management to seek a higher position with more responsibility. However, with no growth
      opportunities available, I seized the chance when a better and more challenging role presented itself and moved on to further my career.</p>

    <p style="color: white; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Before Undergrad</p>
    <p>Before earning my bachelor’s degree, I gained valuable customer service experience through several jobs that helped shape my interpersonal skills and work ethic. At 16, I started working at Subway,
      where I spent a total of seven years. Over the years, I developed strong communication skills, learned how to handle fast-paced environments, and worked my way up to an Assistant Manager position.
      In this role, I was responsible for training new employees, managing inventory, and ensuring customer satisfaction. My ability to handle difficult situations with customers and maintain smooth operations
      earned me recognition from both customers and management, even though the pay was not reflective of the hard work I was putting in. Eventually, the lack of career advancement and low pay led me to seek new
      opportunities. In 2015, a friend from my Calculus 3 course introduced me to LAZ Parking, where I began working while pursuing my degree. Over the next five years, I worked my way up to a Supervisor role.
      At LAZ, I enjoyed the hospitality and customer service side of the business, and I excelled in managing a team and resolving issues that arose with customers. I took pride in providing excellent service
      and was frequently praised for my ability to handle high-pressure situations efficiently. The pay was excellent, and the people I worked with were great, making the experience rewarding. However, when I was
      furloughed during the pandemic in 2020, I decided to shift gears and focus on finishing my degree strong, ultimately deciding not to return when the opportunity arose. By the time I was nearing the end
      of my undergrad, I had taken a role at Instructure, which allowed me to further refine my customer service skills and apply my growing technical knowledge. These jobs, especially the leadership roles I held,
      taught me important lessons in empathy, communication, and adaptability—skills that have proven essential in my career as an engineer. I’m grateful for these early career experiences because they not only
      honed my ability to work cross-functionally with diverse teams but also made me a more empathetic person, traits that I bring with me into every engineering project I work on.</p>
